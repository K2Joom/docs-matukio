It's a pretty big overview showing a lot of informations.

In the third column you see the Event title for which the date is created. If you click on the title you are redirected to the **date** edit form. One column right you see the event id. When you click on this one, you will be on the **event** edit form.

### Event Number

In Matukio every event has an unique event number, you can define it yourself or use the integrated algorithm. Which uses a continuing number and the year (number/year) the event takes place.

If you don't want to use it just disable it in the settings.

### Cancelled

If you click on the cancel icon, the date for the event is canceled. All participants are informed about this by email (as long as you don't disable this feature in the settings).
