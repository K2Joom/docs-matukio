# Import (Administrator)

Matukio offers various import interfaces for events.

### CSV file import


### ICS file import

You can easily import events from an ICS calendar file (version 2).

The event data is mapped the following way:

* Event title = VEVENT SUMMARY
* Brief description = SUMMARY
* Place = LOCATION
* Description = DESCRIPTION
* Begin = DTSTART
* End = DTEND
* Closing = DTSTART
* Category = Set in the import dialog
* Updated = Current date
* Publishdate = Current date
* Publisher / Organizer = Current user
