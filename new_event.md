# Create a new Event

Event Management -> Events

> You need to create a category first!

Just click on "New" in the events overview. After this the event creation form will show up (It is the same for editing).

The event creation form can be a bit complex at the beginning as there are a lot of options and settings. But you only need to complete the first page (Fields marked with an Asterisk *) to create an event. Everything else is optional.

### Begin, end and closing date

Please insert the dates in the following date format (or just use the calendar):

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

2016-01-31 15:01:10

This is the default ISO format of dates and used in all Matukio forms. In the Joomla frontend it is formatted based on your settings in the Matukio configuration.


### Recurring event generator

If you want to set up an recurring event just set the option to "Yes". After this a date generator will show up.

> Please note: If you change the recurring settings of an existing event, all old dates are going to be deleted and are newly generated. Use this option with care! You can edit every date and / or set up new ones in the Dates View.

In it you can select repeating types, the count of dates or how long the dates should be repeated.

After you have set up your recurring settings click on generate. After this a list of dates will show up. You can also edit them manually following the default date scheme: YYYY-MM-DD. Just click on the little x to remove a date.

The span between begin and end of an recurring event is depending on the time between the begin and end setting of the event itself. The same goes for the closing date.
