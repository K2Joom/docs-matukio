# Error: 404 / 500 View / Controller not found

>This error always shows up if the Joomla! routing to an extension fails.

To work properly Matukio Events needs a Joomla menu entry to event-list overview (can be on a hidden menu).

Else the routing with Joomla search engine friendly URL's will not work.

For a detailed description see also [Routing (SEF URLs)](routing.md)
