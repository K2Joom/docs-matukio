## Issues with Joomla! templates

### Admin templates

Matukio is only tested with the default Joomla! admin template (Isis) and we only support this one.

### Frontend templates

Matukio is optimized to work with almost all Joomla! templates. We particularly made sure it works together with the common template providers (Like Joomlarts T3, Rockettheme, Gavick etc.).

Our CSS code is priorized (with a container - compojoom-bootstrap), so normally your template should not interfere with it.
