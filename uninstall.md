# Uninstall Matukio Events

> Please note the uninstaller does **not** delete the #__matukio tables out of security reasons. So you need to manually delete them to remove Matukio completely or start from scratch.

You can uninstall Matukio like any other Joomla! component. If you uninstall the Main component (just called Matukio) all plugins, modules etc. are also uninstalled.

As a super administrator just navigate to Extensions -> Extension Manager -> Manage, than search for Matukio, select it and click on uninstall.
