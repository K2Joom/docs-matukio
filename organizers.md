# Organizers (Administrator)

> Organizers are normal Joomla! users in Matukio, which are by default allowed to edit and manage their event and bookings (you can change that) 

In this section we are mostly going to look at the organize pages, not at the management / user part of them. An organizer view / page is not required for managing events! It's just for presenting her / him!

Starting with Matukio 5.3, for every user you select as publisher (or which submit events) an organizer profile is created.
