## Installation

Installing Matukio is not different than installing any other Joomla!™ extension on your site. You can read the complete instructions for installing Joomla!™ extensions on the official help page. 

Throughout this chapter we assume that you are familiar with these instructions.

###Getting the installation packages

You can download the latest installation package in the download area of our site. You have to Login first. If you own a valid subscription you will see the Download -> Matukio menu item. 

Click on it. 

The releases are listed with the newest release always on top. Click on the release number and then download the ZIP package.

The installation package can be installed on Joomla 3.x. You can use the installation package to update from previous version as well. Just install it, without uninstalling the old package.


>####Note

> The Zip package includes all available modules, plugins and libraries. During the installation of the component they will be installed automatically. The German translations is directly included in Matukio, so you don't need to install it separately.
