# Using Matukio Events Component

We know that you are impatient! You want to know the short story and you don't like to read a lot. Ok! So, here is the absolute minimum of steps that you need to make in order to see the component in action:

1. Navigate to Components -> Matukio
2. Create an event category
3. Create an event
4. Create a Joomla menu link pointing to Matukio event-list Overview. This is **mandatory** for search engine friendly URLs! It can be hidden!

If you managed to do this - congratulations! You seem to be an advanced Joomla user - so you know the procedure - play around with the component and you will figure most features out!

You didn't manage to follow the above steps? Don't worry, let us examine each view of the component and explain what all those buttons are for. We will proceed with each section in the order it appears in the toolbar menu. We have also a couple of Youtube tutorial videos on how to use Matukio Events:
