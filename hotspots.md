# Show your events on the Hotspots Map

[Hotspots](https://compojoom.com/joomla-extensions/hotspots) offers an integration for Matukio Events, enabling you to show your events on a map, see [this demo](http://matukio.compojoom.com/events-map) for an example.

In the [Hotspots documentation](https://compojoom.com/support/documentation/hotspots) you can find a [detailed guide](https://compojoom.com/support/documentation/hotspots/ch04s08) on how to set up the mapping between the two extensions.
