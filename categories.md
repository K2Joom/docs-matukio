# Categories for Matukio Events (Admin)

Event Management -> Categories

> We use the Joomla! category manager in Matukio Events. Because of this the administrator area of Matukio looks different there.

Creating a category (or multiple) is basically the first thing you need to do after installing Matukio. It's pretty straight forward.
