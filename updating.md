# Updating Matukio Events

> Please note that updating **never** requires uninstalling the extension before!


There are multiple ways to update Matukio Events.

### Update automatically (Joomla extension updater)

>This Joomla! feature requires that your server supports fopen() URL wrappers (allow_url_fopen is set to 1 in your server's php.ini file) or has the PHP cURL extension enabled. Moreover, if your server has a firewall, it has to allow TCP connections over ports 80 and 443 to compojoom.com and cdn.compojoom.com. If you don't see any updates or if they fail to download please ask your host to check that these conditions are met. If they are met but you still do not see the updates please file a bug report in the official Joomla! forum. In the meantime you can use the manual update methods discussed further below this page.

**You first have to enter your personal Download ID in order to use this feature.** You can find your main download ID, or create additional Download IDs, on our site's Download IDs page. Then go to your site's administrator page and click on Components, Matukio Events, and click on the Options button in the toolbar. 

Click on the Updates tab and paste your Download ID to the Download ID field. Finally, click on Save & Close. Please note though that you'll need an active Matukio subscription for updating!


Matukio Events can be updated using the Joomla! extensions update feature. Joomla! is responsible for finding the updates, downloading them and installing them on your server. You can access the extensions update feature in two different ways:

**From the icon on your Joomla! administrator control panel page:**

On Joomla! 3 you will find the icon in the left-hand sidebar, under the Maintenance header. It has an icon which looks like an empty star. When there are updates found for any of your extensions you will see the Updates are available message. Clicking on it will get you to the Update page of Joomla! Extensions Manager.

**From the Extensions Manager**

From the top menu of your Joomla! administrator click on Extensions, Extensions Manager. From that page click on the Update tab found in the left-hand sidebar on Joomla!. Clicking on it will get you to the Update page of Joomla! Extensions Manager.

If you do not see the updates try clicking on the Find Updates button in the toolbar. If you do not see the updates still you may want to wait up to 24 hours before retrying. This has to do with the way the update CDN works and how Joomla! caches the update information. Unfortunately we can't do anything about it, especially in Joomla! 3 (there is no way to forcibly clean the updates cache).

If there is an update available for Matukio Events tick the box to the left of its row and then click on the Update button in the toolbar. Joomla! will now download and install the update.


### Update manually

Updating manually is working the same way as the installation. Just download the latest version from our website (compojoom.com) and install it with the Joomla installer. No uninstallation etc. required.


> Please note: To download updates you need an active subscription.
