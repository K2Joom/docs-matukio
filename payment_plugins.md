# Payment Plugins (Development)

Matukio uses the [Joomla Common Payments API](https://github.com/techjoomla/joomla-payments). The API allows you to easily create your own payment plugins or extend a current one.


## Autodetection

Matukio automatically detects installed payment plugins (Type payment) plg_payment_xy. After you enabled your plugin it automatically shows up in the list of available payment methods in Matukio.

We can also make you a quote on developing a plugin for you.
